# voice_dictionary
Often, finding a word in a physical dictionary is incredibly tedious. This software is the solution to that problem. The software provides a hands-off experience for the user by allowing them to find the definition, synonym, antonym, or translation of a word by using their voice. Read more on the code in the README file.
The software first speaks to the user by greeting them and asking them to choose between finding a word's definition, synonym, antonym, or translation to Spanish. It then displays those options on the screens in separate lines. The user then speaks out their desired option and the software processes it. Next, the software asks the user to say a word that they would like to input into the dictionary. Once the user says their desired word, the software processes it and prints the result on the screen while reading it out loud to the user. Then, the software speaks out its goodbye message.
